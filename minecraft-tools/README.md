# Minecraft Tools

A collection of Javascript programs to use with Minecraft.

These tools generate code to input into Minecraft's
[Command Blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block). These blocks
let admins and map creators run arbitrary commands when they receive a redstone
signal (Minecraft's electricity equivalent). The commands can also be run by
admins through the game's chat/command log.

## Tools

### Armor Color Code Generator

Minecraft has [leather armor](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dye#Dyeing_armor)
that can be dyed in various colors. Admins can create armor pieces with
arbitrary colors by setting JSON datatags on the armor.

The tool allows you to select a color using the native color picker, enter a hex
code, or RGB values. The corresponding color code is then calculated and example
usage is displayed, such as the command below.

```
/give @p leather_chestplate 1 0 {display:{color:10980749}}
```

### HideFlags Calculator

Various Minecraft items have special descriptions displayed in a tooltip, such
as enchantments. While helpful for normal play, map makers may want to hide this
information from the player.

A bitflag is used to indicate which attributes an admin wants to hide on an
item. The tool displays various checkboxes to the user, and will display the
bitflag nessecary to hide the checked values on an in-game item. An example
command is displayed, such as the one below.

```
/give @p iron_pickaxe 1 0 {HideFlags:31}
```
